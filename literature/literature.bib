  abstract  = "{This book deals with all aspects of gravitational-wave physics, both theoretical and experimental. This first volume deals with gravitational wave (GW) theory and experiments. Part I discusses the theory of GWs, re-deriving afresh and in a coherent way all the results presented. Both the geometrical and the field-theoretical approach to general relativity are discussed. The generation of GWs is discussed first in linearized theory (including the general multipole expansion) and then within the post-Newtonian formalism. Many important calculations (inspiral of compact binaries, GW emission by rotating or precessing bodies, infall into black holes, etc.) are presented. The observation of GWs emission from the change in the orbital period of binary pulsar, such as the Hulse-Taylor pulsar and the double pulsar, is also explained, and the pulsar timing formula is derived. Part II discusses the principles of GW experiments, going into the detail of the functioning of both interferometers and resonant-mass detectors. One chapter is devoted to the data analysis techniques relevant for GW experiments.}",

  abstract = "{The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will open the mHz frequency window of the gravitational-wave (GW) landscape. Among all the new GW sources expected to emit in this frequency band, extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) constitute a unique laboratory for astrophysics and fundamental physics. Here, we show that EMRIs can also be used to extract relevant cosmological information, complementary to both electromagnetic (EM) and other GW observations. By using the loudest EMRIs (S/N \\&gt; 100) detected by LISA as dark standard sirens, statistically matching their sky localization region with mock galaxy catalogues, we find that constraints on H0 can reach ∼1.1 per cent (∼3.6 per cent) accuracy, at the 90 per cent credible level, in our best(worst)- case scenario. By considering a dynamical dark energy (DE) cosmological model, with ΛCDM parameters fixed by other observations, we further show that in our best(worst)- case scenario ∼5.9 per cent (∼12.3 per cent) relative uncertainties at the 90 per cent credible level can be obtained on w0, the DE equation of state parameter. Besides being relevant in their own right, EMRI measurements will be affected by different systematics compared to both EM and ground-based GW observations. Cross-validation with complementary cosmological measurements will therefore be of paramount importance, especially if convincing evidence of physics beyond ΛCDM emerges from future observations.}",
